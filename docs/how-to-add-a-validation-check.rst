How to add a validation check
=============================

Data validation takes place in the `lib-cove-ocds <https://github.com/open-contracting/lib-cove-ocds>`_ library and are presented in the UI via templates in cove-ocds.

'Common checks' process the various different objects in a release, so the data can be validated against the schema and statistics about different aspects of the data (eg. the number of contracts, the range of dates, or number of unique organizations present) can be presented in the UI. This happens in ``lib/common_checks.py``.

'Additional checks' are for data validation beyond what is covered by validation against the `OCDS Schema <https://github.com/open-contracting/lib-cove-ocds/blob/main/libcoveocds/schema.py>`_ - that is, the results of these checks may suggest an issue with the data where the issue does not cause data to be invalid against the schema - and are implemented in ``lib/additional_checks.py``. An example of such a check is identifying when fields, objects and arrays exist but are empty or contain only whitespace.

What follows is an outline of how to add a check. This will involve making changes in both `lib-cove-ocds` and `cove-ocds`.

Changes to ``lib-cove-ocds``
----------------------------

Make new class for your check, subclassing the ``AdditionalCheck`` class in ``lib/additional_checks.py``. This class makes variables available to store whether a check has failed (``self.failed``, a bool) and the output of the check (``self.output``, an array), and expects you to override the ``process`` method in order to carry out the check.

.. code-block:: python

    class SampleCheck(AdditionalCheck):
        """A check on some field to make sure the data smells right."""

        def process(self, data, path_prefix):
            pass


The items in the ``output`` array should be dicts with a key for ``type`` at a minimum as well as anything else you want to pass through to be displayed in the template. The value of ``type`` is just a string so that in the template you can customize the display of the results of each type of check. Other things in the output might be the JSON path of the value which failed the check, and the value itself.

Carry out the validation in the ``process`` function of your new class:

.. code-block:: python

    def process(self, data, path_prefix):

        # Do your validation here

        # When something fails:
        self.failed = True

        # Pass results through with, eg:
        self.output.append({
         'type': 'sample_check',
         'something_useful': a_helpful_value,
         'json_location': path_prefix
        })

To loop through the input data to process it, you can flatten it first, ie:

.. code-block:: python

    flattened_data = dict(flatten_dict(data))

    for key, value in flattened_data.items():
        # do stuff with each field

Add the class to the array of checks so they get run when data is loaded (this happens in `the top level common_checks.py <https://github.com/open-contracting/lib-cove-ocds/blob/main/libcoveocds/common_checks.py>`_).

.. code-block:: python

    TEST_CLASSES = {
        'additional': [
            # ...
            SampleCheck
            # ...
        ]
    }

Add tests for your new check in ``tests/test_additional_checks.py``. You might need to add new test data in ``tests/fixtures/additional_checks/``.

Changes to ``cove-ocds``
------------------------

The templates need updating to display the results of your additional checks. It's likely that the only file you need to modify is ``templates/cove_ocds/additional_checks_table.html``. 

Add a clause for your new check using ``{% if type == 'sample_check' %}`` (where ``sample_check`` is the ``type`` you set in the output) and then display the results how you see fit. You can integrate them into the existing additional checks table, or output them some other way if that makes more sense. Iterate through the output you set, eg:

.. code-block:: html

    {% for value in values|slice:":3" %}
      <li>{{ value.something_useful }}</li>
    {% endfor %}

If you add new copy to the template, don't forget the :doc:`translations`.

Releasing changes
-----------------

When you make changes in `lib-cove-ocds` that changes in `cove-ocds` are dependent upon, remember to update the version number of `lib-cove-ocds` in the same PR, and make a new release once the PR is merged. Then in your PR against `cove-ocds` you can also update the version of the `lib-cove-ocds` dependency to match your update.
